        <p class="Bio-Paragraph">Samantha Figueroa, Sam, is a 24-year-old born and raised in California. She comes from a Hispanic background and therefore was always surrounded by music. 
        Growing up, she was always involved in something creative, from poetry to playing an instrument. Through patience and dedication, she has used her creativity to share her talents.
        She started playing the guitar at age 15, then picked up the ukulele a few years later. 
        Then, she finally learned how to play the piano at the age of 20. Just a few months after, she learned about the production side of music and has been able to compose and make her music. 
        Thus, releasing three songs inspired by real experiences on Spotify and Apple Music for everyone to hear. 
        Her creativity and open-mindedness have also allowed her to divulge in several other outlets. 
        These things include things like video games or YouTube. 
        Stepping out of her comfort zone had allowed her to be successful in something she would have never considered, streaming on Twitch. 
        She also created videos for YouTube about her first-time experiences for others to see. These activities allowed her to interact intimately with her fans, friends, and family. 
        Coming from a family-oriented household, Sam has been able to make several different connections and close relationships with people around her. 
        Their mutual love for Disney and Legos allows her to spend time with those she loves the most. 
        Sam constantly wants to learn, meet new people, and explore the world. Sam is always on the move and ready to take on any challenges that get in her way.</p>
